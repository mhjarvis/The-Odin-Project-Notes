# Fundamentals
##### The 'script' Tag
    <script src="/path/to/script1.js"></script>                 //using an absolute path
    <script src="https://something.script.js"></script>         //using url
    <script src="/path/to/script2.js"></script>                 //linking to multiple files
##### 'use strict'
Makes applied to code work the modern way. 
##### var vs let
'var' has no block scope, for example, a variable declared in a if-then statement can be called outside that statement if declared with 'var' instead of 'let'.
##### Variables
Can begin with letters, '$', and '_ '. Cannot contain hyphens. Case matters. 
### Data Types
##### Numbers
Consists of integers and floats. NaN represents a computational error caused by a incorrect or an undefined mathematical operation. NaN is sticky meaning that any further attempts on NaN will return NaN.
    alert(1 / 0);                       //will return infinity (division by zero)
    alert("not a number" / 2);          //NaN
##### BigInt
The 'number' type cannot represent values greater than 2^(53) - 1 or 9007199254740991.
##### Strings
Strings can use '', "", ``. Backticks have 'extended functionality'. They allow for embeding variables and expressions into a string by wrapping them in ${...}. The expression inside ${...} is evaluated and the result becomes part of the string. 

    let name = "John";
    alert( `Hello, ${name}!` );         //Hello, John
    alert( `the result is ${1 + 2}` );  //the result is 3
In JavaScript there is no char type.
##### Boolean (logical type)
Boolean type has only two values: true, false.
##### The 'undefined' Value
The meaning of undefined is 'value not assigned', as in ```let num;```.
