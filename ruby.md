## Basic Data Types
#### Numbers

    1 + 1               //addition
    2 - 1               //subtraction
    2 * 2               //multiplication
    10 / 5              //division
    2 ** 2              //exponent
    8 % 3               //modulus

### Integers and Floats
Integers are whole numbers, scuh as 5 or 21. Floats are numbers that contain a deciml point, such as 10.5 or 2.34. Keep in mind that doing arithmetic with two integers will always return an integer. Substitute a float to get accurate results:

    17 / 5              //returns 3
    17 / 5.0            //returns 3.4

#### Converting Number Types
When converting from a float to an integer, Ruby will drop any decimal places. There is no rounding that takes place. Converting an integer to a float:

    13.to_f             //13.0

Converting from a float to an integer:

    13.0.to_i           //13

#### Checking Even/Odd
Some useful methods for working with numbers:

    6.even?             //true
    7.even?             //false

    6.odd?              //false
    7.odd?              //true





## Review
1. List the basic arithmetic operators and what they do.
2. Describe the difference between an integer and a float and how to convert between the two.
3. Explain string interpolation and concatenation.
4. Describe what escape characters are, and list several examples.
5. Define what a symbol is and how it differs from a string.
6. Explain what the Booleans true, false, and nil represent.
