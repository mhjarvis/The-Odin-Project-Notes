1. Run ```npm init``` to generate a package.json file.
2. Run ```npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev``` to install webpack to the node modules directory of your project.
3. Create ```src``` and ```dist``` folders.
4. Create a ```index.js``` file in ```src```.
5. Create a ```index.html``` file in ```dist```. Link the ```main.js``` file in a script tag (file will bet generated by webpack).
6. Create a ```webpack.config.js``` file with the following code:

        const path = require('path');
        module.exports = {
          entry: './src/index.js',
          output: {
            filename: 'main.js',
            path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
          },
        };

7. Run build again using ```npx webpack --config webpack.config.js```
8. Create HTML skeleton inside of ```dist/index.html```.
9. Run ```npx webpack --watch``` to prevent needing to run webpack everytime you make a change.
